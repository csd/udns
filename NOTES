Assorted notes about udns (library).

UDP-only mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, since udns is (currently) UDP-only, there are some
shortcomings.

It assumes that a reply will fit into a UDP buffer.  With adoption of EDNS0,
and general robustness of IP stacks, in most cases it's not an issue.  But
in some cases there may be problems:

 - if an RRset is "very large" so it does not fit even in buffer of size
   requested by the library (current default is 4096; some servers limits
   it further), we will not see the reply, or will only see "damaged"
   reply (depending on the server)

 - many DNS servers ignores EDNS0 option requests.  In this case, no matter
   which buffer size udns library will request, such servers reply is limited
   to 512 bytes (standard pre-EDNS0 DNS packet size).

 - some DNS servers, notable the ones used by Verisign for certain top-level
   domains, chokes on EDNS0-enabled queries, returning FORMERR.  Such
   behavior isn't prohibited by DNS standards, but in my opinion it's at
   least weird - the server can easily ignore EDNS0 options and send a
   reply, instead of sending error.
   Currently, udns does nothing in this situation, completely ignoring the
   error returned by the server, and continue waiting for reply.  It probably
   should grok that this server does not understand EDNS0 and retry w/o the
   options, but it does not.  The end result - esp. if your local DNS
   server or - worse - broken firewall which inspects DNS packets and drops
   the ones which - from its point of view - are "broken" - is that you
   see only TEMPFAIL errors from the library trying to resolve ANY names.

Implementing TCP mode (together with non-EDNS0 fall-back as above) isn't
difficult, but it complicates API significantly.  Currently udns uses only
single UDP socket (or - maybe in the future - two, see below), but in case of
TCP, it will need to open and close sockets for TCP connections left and
right, and that have to be integrated into an application's event loop in
an easy and efficient way.  Plus all the timeouts - different for connect(),
write, and several stages of read.

IPv6 vs IPv4 usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is only relevant for nameservers reachable over IPv6, NOT for IPv6
queries.  I.e., if you've IPv6 addresses in 'nameservers' line in your
/etc/resolv.conf file.  Even more: if you have BOTH IPv6 AND IPv4 addresses
there.  Or pass them to udns initialization routines.

Since udns uses a single UDP socket to communicate with all nameservers,
it should support both v4 and v6 communications.  Most current platforms
supports this mode - using PF_INET6 socket and V4MAPPED addresses, i.e,
"tunnelling" IPv4 inside IPv6.  But not all systems supports this.  And
more, it has been said that such mode is deprecated.

So, list only IPv4 or only IPv6 addresses, but don't mix them, in your
/etc/resolv.conf.

An alternative is to use two sockets instead of 1 - one for IPv6 and one
for IPv4.  For now I'm not sure if it's worth the complexity - again, of
the API, not the library itself (but this will not simplify library either).

Single socket for all queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using single UDP socket for sending queries to all nameservers has obvious
advantages.  First it's, again, trivial, simple to use API.  And simple
library too.  Also, after sending queries to all nameservers (in case first
didn't reply in time), we will be able to receive late reply from first
nameserver and accept it.

But this mode has disadvantages too.  Most important is that it's much easier
to send fake reply to us, as the UDP port where we expects the reply to come
to is constant during the whole lifetime of an application.  More secure
implementations uses random port for every single query.  While port number
(16 bits integer) can not hold much randomness, it's still of some help.
Ok, udns is a stub resolver, so it expects sorta friendly environment, but
on LAN it's usually much easier to fire an attack, due to the speed of local
network, where a bad guy can generate alot of packets in a short time.

Choosing of DNS QueryID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is more a TODO item really.  Currently, udns uses sequential number for
query IDs.  Which simplifies attacks even more (c.f. the previous item about
single UDP port), making them nearly trivial.  The library should use random
number for query ID.  But there's no portable way to get random numbers, even
on various flavors of Unix.  It's possible to use low bits from tv_nsec field
returned by gettimeofday() (current time, nanoseconds), but I wrote the library
in a way to avoid making system calls where possible, because many syscalls
means many context switches and slow processes as a result.  Maybe use some
application-supplied callback to get random values will be a better way,
defaulting to gettimeofday() method.

Note that a single query - even if (re)sent to different nameservers, several
times (due to no reply received in time), uses the same qID assigned when it
was first dispatched.  So we have: single UDP socket (fixed port number),
sequential (= trivially predictable) qIDs, and long lifetime of those qIDs.
This all makes (local) attacks against the library really trivial.

Assumptions about RRs returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently udns processes records in the reply it received sequentially.
This means that order of the records is significant.  For example, if
we asked for foo.bar A, but the server returned that foo.bar is a CNAME
(alias) for bar.baz, and bar.baz, in turn, has address 1.2.3.4, when
the CNAME should come first in reply, followed by A.  While DNS specs
does not say anything about order of records - it's an rrSET - unordered, -
I think an implementation which returns the records in "wrong" order is
somewhat insane...  Well ok, to be fair, I don't really remember how
udns handles this now - need to check this in source... ;)

CNAME recursion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another dark point of udns is the handling of CNAMEs returned as replies
to non-CNAME queries.  If we asked for foo.bar A, but it's a CNAME, udns
expects BOTH the CNAME itself and the target DN to be present in the reply.
In other words, udns DOES NOT RECURSE CNAMES.  If we asked for foo.bar A,
but only record in reply was that foo.bar is a CNAME for bar.baz, udns will
return no records to an application (NXDOMAIN).  Strictly speaking, udns
should repeat the query asking for bar.baz A, and recurse.  But since it's
stub resolver, recursive resolver should recurse for us instead.

It's not very difficult to implement, however.  Probably with some (global?)
flag to en/dis-able the feature.  Provided there's some demand for it.

To clarify: udns handles CNAME recursion in a single reply packet just fine.

Error reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Too many places in the code (various failure paths) sets generic "TEMPFAIL"
error condition.  For example, if no nameserver replied to our query, an
application will get generic TEMPFAIL, instead of something like TIMEDOUT.
This probably should be fixed, but most applications don't care about the
exact reasons of failure - 4 common cases are already too much:
  - query returned some valid data
  - NXDOMAIN
  - valid domain but no data of requested type - =NXDOMAIN in most cases
  - temporary error - this one sometimes (incorrectly!) treated as NXDOMAIN
    by (naive) applications.
DNS isn't yes/no, it's at least 3 variants, temp err being the 3rd important
case!  And adding more variations for the temp error case is complicating things
even more - again, from an application writer standpoint.  For diagnostics,
such more specific error cases are of good help.

Planned API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At least one thing I want to change for 0.1 version is a way how queries are
submitted.

I want to made dns_query object to be owned by an application.  So that instead
of udns library allocating it for the lifetime of query, it will be pre-
allocated by an application.  This simplifies and enhances query submitting
interface, and complicates it a bit too, in simplest cases.

Currently, we have:

dns_submit_dn(dn, cls, typ, flags, parse, cbck, data)
dns_submit_p(name, cls, typ, flags, parse, cbck, data)
dns_submit_a4(ctx, name, flags, cbck, data)

and so on -- with many parameters missed for type-specific cases, but generic
cases being too complex for most common usage.

Instead, with dns_query being owned by an app, we will be able to separately
set up various parts of the query - domain name (various forms), type&class,
parser, flags, callback...  and even change them at runtime.  And we will also
be able to reuse query structures, instead of allocating/freeing them every
time.  So the whole thing will look something like:

 q = dns_alloc_query();
 dns_submit(dns_q_flags(dns_q_a4(q, name, cbck), DNS_F_NOSRCH), data);

The idea is to have a set of functions accepting struct dns_query* and
returning it (so the calls can be "nested" like the above), to set up
relevant parts of the query - specific type of callback, conversion from
(type-specific) query parameters into a domain name (this is for type-
specific query initializers), and setting various flags and options and
type&class things.

One example where this is almost essential - if we want to support
per-query set of nameservers (which isn't at all useless: imagine a
high-volume mail server, were we want to direct DNSBL queries to a separate
set of nameservers, and rDNS queries to their own set and so on).  Adding
another argument (set of nameservers to use) to EVERY query submitting
routine is.. insane.  Especially since in 99% cases it will be set to
default NULL.  But with such "nesting" of query initializers, it becomes
trivial.
